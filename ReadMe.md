# Family tree since Moctezuma

Please take a look at notebooks/family.ipynb since there lies all the information.
The .py are still a work in progress so please understand.

The process of moving info from the PDF to the csv was MANUAL and PAINFUL. 
If you know or want to propose a PDF scraping technique feel free to do a pull request.

Greetings!
